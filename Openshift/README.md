h1. How to configure a CI/CD pipeline for DMOD on OpenShift

- Create a project to house the Jenkins instance that will be responsible for promoting application images (via OpenShift ImageStreamTagS) across environment; the exact project name used was "csnr-dmod".
- Create the BuildConfiguration within this project using the ```oc``` command and "dmod-build-template.json" file in the templates directory:

```
oc process -f dmod-build-template.json -v NAME=<product-name> -v SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL=<github url> -v SOURCE_REPOSITORY_REF=<branch or ref> | oc create -f -```
```

For example:

```
oc process -f dmod-build-template.json -v NAME=epic-gmtr -v SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL=https://github.com/bcgov/cnsr-dmod.git -v | oc create -f -```
```



- Deploy a Jenkins instance with persistent storage into the esm project using the web gui
- Install the Promoted Builds Jenkins plugin
- Configure a job that has an OpenShift ImageStream Watcher as its SCM source and promotion states for each environment
- In each promotion configuration, tag the target build's image to the appropriate promotion level; this was done using a shell command because the OpenShift plugins do not appear to handle parameter subsitution inside promotions properly.
- Create an OpenShift project for each "environment" (e.g. DEV, TEST, PROD, DEMO, TRAIN); Exact names used were esm-dev, esm-test, esm-prod, esm-demo, esm-train
- Configure the access controls to allow the Jenkins instance to tag imagestreams in the environment projects, and to allow the environment projects to pull images from the esm project:
 
```
oc policy add-role-to-user system:image-puller system:serviceaccount:esm-<env-name>:default -n esm
oc policy add-role-to-user edit system:serviceaccount:esm:default -n esm-<env-name>
```
 
- Use the JSON files in this directory  and `oc` tool to create the necessary resources within each project:

```
oc process -f esm-environment-template.json -v NAME=esm-<env-name>,APPLICATION_DOMAIN=esm-<env-name>.pathfinder.bcgov,APP_IMAGE_NAMESPACE=esm,APP_DEPLOYMENT_TAG=<env-name> | oc create -f -
```

For example:

```
oc process -f dmod-environment-template.json -v NAME=dmod-dev,APPLICATION_DOMAIN=dmod-prod.pathfinder.bcgov,APP_IMAGE_NAMESPACE=esm,APP_DEPLOYMENT_TAG=prod,DOCUMENT_VOLUME_CAPACITY=200Gi,DATABASE_VOLUME_CAPACITY=10Gi | oc create -f -
```

h1. DMOD Environment

At this time there is only one DMOD environment, the Dev environment.


h1. How to access Jenkins for ESM

- Login to https://esm-jenkins-esm.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca with the username/password that was provided to you.

h1. How to access OpenShift for ESM

h2. Web UI
- Login to https://console.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca:8443; you'll be prompted for GitHub authorization.

h2. Command-line (```oc```) tools
- Download OpenShift [command line tools](https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases/download/v1.2.1/openshift-origin-client-tools-v1.2.1-5e723f6-mac.zip), unzip, and add ```oc``` to your PATH.  
- Copy command line login string from https://console.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca:8443/console/command-line.  It will look like ```oc login https://console.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca:8443 --token=xtyz123xtyz123xtyz123xtyz123```
- Paste the login string into a terminal session.  You are no authenticated against OpenShift and will be able to execute ```oc``` commands. ```oc -h``` provides a summary of available commands.

h1. Project contents

- The "esm" project contains the Jenkins instance and the other esm-* projects contain different "environments".  The names are self-explanatory.

h1. Data management operations

Document load (from legacy EPIC -> *new EPIC*)

```oc rsh <app-pod> bash -c 'cd scripts && MONGO_CONNECTION=mongodb://${MONGODB_USER}:${MONGODB_PASSWORD}@${MONGODB_PORT_27017_TCP_ADDR}/esm DOWNLOADS_DIR=/uploads ./run.sh'```

Count documents

```oc rsh <mongo-pod> bash -c 'mongo -u ${MONGODB_USER} -p ${MONGODB_PASSWORD} --eval "printjson(db.documents.count())" esm'```

Connect to database as admin

```oc rsh <mongo-pod> 
mongo -u admin -p ${MONGODB_ADMIN_PASSWORD} admin
```

Drop database

- Connect as admin (see above)

```
use esm
db.dropDatabase()
```

Transport endpoint is not connected healthcheck solution:

As soon as the volume 'goes away' your application will also be torn down 
and unavailable until such time as the glusterFS/NFS/Remote mount comes back.  
This is because the healthcheck once failed with kill the pod(s).  This may or 
may not be desirable based on your individual application behaviors.
